    "dc_description_s": "An Irrigation Non-expansion Area (INA) is a geographical area that has been designated as having insufficient groundwater to provide a reasonably safe supply for the irrigation of the cultivated lands at the current rate of withdrawal. Within INAs, new agricultural use of land occurring on land that was not irrigated in the five years preceding the designation of the INA is prohibited with a few exceptions for substitution or transfer of acres under specified circumstances. The 1980 Groundwater Management Act established two Irrigation Non-Expansion Areas - Joseph City INA and Douglas INA. The Harquahala INA was created in 1981. The Phoenix AMA manages the Joseph City and Harquahala INAs. INAs have restrictions on increasing their number of irrigated acres. This dataset depicts grandfathered groudwater rights (GFRs) in the three INAs. This file was pulled from the Arizona Grandfathered Groundwater Rights (GFRs) CD-ROM Database.
