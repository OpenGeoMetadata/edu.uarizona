    "dc_description_s": "This element was computed using snowfall data from the National Climatic Data Center's United States Snow Climatology (TD-9641M) database (NCDC, 1999c). The original snowfall data is given to a tenth of an inch. This element is given as the number of whole days. The 29-year mean of the number of days with snowfall at or above the four thresholds: 0.1 inch, 1.0 inch, 5.0, inches and 10.0 inches were computed for the snow season, August 1 - July 31. The first snow season commenced on August 1, 1961 and the last snow season ended on July 31, 1990. Data extracted for Arizona and 25 mile buffer.",
